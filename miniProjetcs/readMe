In an attempt to become a bit more familiar with Python and get to remember some basic concepts of the syntax,
I started creating some classic beginner exercise projects(not longer than a few lines each). 
1) miniProjects has several small exercises on basic Python concepts(lists, inputs , randoms)
2)coinToss has two pseudo-simulations of tossing a coin and a dice
